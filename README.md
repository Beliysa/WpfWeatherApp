# WpfWeatherApp
This is a simple wpf weather application.
If you want to open the project and run on your machine you need to create and get your own api key for using OpenWeather api services from : https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up .
After getting your api key, paste it to dedicated "ApiKey" variable on the file "appsettings.json". Then copy this file in the project running directory because this is checked at runtime: bin/Debug/net7.0-windows. (This may differ on your machine).
